# Python-Data-Structures-Implementation:

All the data structures including:

* singly linklist
* Doubly linklist
* Stacks
* Queues
* Binary search tree
* Graph
* Pairing heaps etc 

 are implemented in this repository along with their relevant functions. 

P.S: Its was an empty, forked repository earlier and it is intended to make a PR daily with a new data stucture so presence of any specific data structure is subjected to its pull request. If its not found, it will be uploaded later.
